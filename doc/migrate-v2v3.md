# Open Platform v.2 -> v.3

Changes to the Open Platform API that should be attended when migrating from v. 2 to v. 3:

- New `Suggest/suggest` endpoint, replaces the old `Suggest/suggest` endpoint. Uses new suggester backend.
   - Enhanced response
   - New type: `all`
- New `Recommend/recommend` endpoint, replaces the old `Recommend/recommend` endpoint. Uses new recommender backend.
   - Parameters `offset`, `filters` and `boosters` added
   - Changed response, see below
- `Recommend/rank` endpoint revoked
- `Order/order` endpoint:
   - `orderId` has been split into `orderId` and `orderType`. Both parameters are mandatory when modifying orders. Possible values for orderType are `Estimate`, `Hold`, `Loan`, `Non-returnable Copy`, `normal`, and `Stack Retrieval`.
   - `library` parameter renamed to `pickUpBranch`.
- `Order/availability` now takes a *list* of pids - and returns a *list* of items.
- New `Status/status` endpoint with status and performance statistics for OpenPlatform
