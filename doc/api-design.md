This is the intended design and not ratified yet.  This document is in-progress.

# General approach to the API

## API structure

__Requests__ to the API consist of the _endpoint name_, and a JSON object of _parameters_.

Parameters are general across endpoints:

- `access_token` is the access token when needed
- `offset` for paginated results, such as search result.
- `limit` for paginated results, - number of results per page.
- `pretty` determines whether the JSON should be prettyprinted when serialising.
- `callback` is the callback name when doing a jsonp request on the HTTP-transport

__Responses__ are returned within an envelope, usually as a JSON object with the following properties:

- `statusCode` contains the status of the request, ie `200` if it went ok.
- `data` contains the actual response, if applicable
- `error` contains a list of errors, if applicable

__The API__ is specified/documented using OpenAPI 2.0 Specification (swagger). 
See http://swagger.io and https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification for more details.
The actual swagger file will be most likely generated from a simpler file.

The generated documentation is exposed at `/v0/`. The WebSocket API is exposed at `/v0/socketcluster`. The HTTP-API is exposed as `/v0/$ENDPOINT-NAME`. 
Version 0 (`/v0`) is the unstable API under development. When the API is finalised, we will change to version 1.

The production API runs ssl-only (HTTPS/WSS).

English is the main language for naming of methods, as well as API-documentation.
We will try to minimise the amount of library jargon, in order to make the API more accessible for developers without domain knowledge.


## Transports

There are several transports:

- HTTP POST requests - the _parameters_ are posted as a JSON object (`Content-Type: application/json`) to an url, given by the `endpoint name`. Supports CORS.
- HTTP GET requests - similar to HTTP-POST requests with same url, but the _parameters_ are given as url-parameters. This is a quick way to try out / experiment with the API. Parameters are parsed as JSON(if possible) and otherwise used as strings. Url-parameters can also be used in POST-requests to override values.
- SocketCluster (WebSockets) - send the request over websocket, and gets a result back, - the event is the endpoint name, the data is the parameters, and the result comes through the callback, when using the socketcluster-client (available for JavaScript, iOS and Android from https://github.com/socketcluster/.).

## Auth

Authentication using OAuth 2. 

TODO clarify document details.

# Notes for the concrete API design

Below is a brainstorm for categories of api-endpoints, including existing usage in mobilsoeg, and  expected use in first version of biblo:

- user
    - mobilsoeg: `findMobilSoegProfile`? `getPickupAgencyList` `getUserStatus` `savePickupAgencyToMobilSoegProfile` `renewLoan` `isMobilSoegUserLoggedIn`
    - biblo: TBD, ie. borrower check
- search
    - mobilsoeg: `getOpenSearchBriefDisplayList` `getOpenSearchFacets` `getOpenSearchFacetTerms` `getOpenSearchResultList`
    - parameter: single serviceprovider, across different libraries.
- suggest
    - mobilsoeg: `getPopSuggestions`
    - biblo: TBD, ie. entity-suggest
- order
    - mobilsoeg: `cancelOrder` `getOrderPolicy`? `placeOrder` `updateOrder`
    - order book
    - update order (ie. change expiry, and pickup-library)
- work
    - mobilsoeg: `getCoverImage` `getOpenSearchWork` `getOpenSearchBriefDisplay` `getRecomendations` `getHoldingStatus`
    - meta data
    - access to electronic resources, ie. link to fulltext, ereolen, etc., 
- recommendations
    - mobilsoeg: `saveLikeToMobilSoegProfile` `getPersonalRecommendations `also on work`? `deleteLikesFromMobilsoegProfile`
- library (agency/affiliates)
    - mobilsoeg: `getAllAffiliates` `getEventById` `getEventList` `getNewsById` `getNewsList` `getOpenAgency`?
    - opening times, geolocation
- misc apis/notes - forum(biblo), questions(sp√∏rgetjeneste etc.)
    - community services (ie. forum) (biblo)
    - questions

List of transforms: getOpenSearchBriefDisplayList getOpenSearchWorkBriefDisplay getOpenSearchFacets getOpenSearchResultList getOpenSearchFacetTerms getOpenSearchWork getCoverImage getPersonalRecommendations getRecommendations commentOnGroupPost createGroup createGroupPost createProfile deleteGroupPost getGroup getGroupPost getProfile joinGroup leaveGroup saveLike loginProfile logoutProfile queryGroups resetLikes updateGroup updateGroupPost updateProfile verifyEmail getPopSuggestions cancelOrder getUserStatus renewLoan updateOrder getFilterGuides getOrderPolicy placeOrder holdingStatus getMultiOpenAgency getOpenAgency getPickupAgencyList searchOpenAgency getEventById getEventList getNewsById getNewsList deleteLikesFromMobilSoegProfile findMobilSoegProfile isMobilSoegUserLoggedIn savePickupAgencyToMobilSoegProfile saveLikeToMobilSoegProfile getAllAffiliates getEntitySuggestions checkBorrower checkBorrowerAndSaveToProfile


Ideas for api-endpoints:

- `/search`
    - possibility to search 
- `/suggest`
    - library-suggestions, different kinds of search query suggestions,
- `/order` - create/update/delete an order
- `/work` - information the creative work
- `/availability` - holdings
    - limit holding check to certain libraries
- `/recommend`
    - possibility to limit results to materials available at the current library.
- `/facets`
- `/user`
    - user status, including arrived loans, orders, etc.
    - set user status (ie. supply default library)
- `/renew`
- `/news`
- `/events`
- `/libraries`

# Random thoughts/ideas, perhaps for later.

- swagger autogenerate server-code..
- look into graphql, and possibilities to use some of this...
- parameters
    - `fields` which keys should be in the returned object.
    - `envelope` specifies whether to have the envelope explicit, or implicit (with status code on HTTP). 
- response
    - paging information
    - information about rate limit when applicable/implemented
- APIs that update state, returns the new state.
- The can also be transferred through HTTP without explicit envelope: the HTTP-status-code is `statusCode`, the HTTP-content is either the `data` (if `statusCode` is 200) or else the `errors`, and some of the HTTP-headers correspond to additional parameters like API-quota/rate-limit, pagination (and the envelope properties is named to match the HTTP-header-names).
- transport `dbc-node-serviceprovider-socketclient` - JavaScript API, that uses the WebSockets transport, with HTTP-POSTs as fallback. this is also how Mobilsoeg and Biblo talks with the service.
