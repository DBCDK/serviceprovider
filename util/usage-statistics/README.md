# Script for extracting usage statistics

__Only works/runs within DBC__.

Simple internal tool, which check which endpoints and clientIds are used.

Notice: this will need to be updated, after we fix #809 and #566, at which point it will stop working.

Run with:

```
npm install
node stat.js # ... and wait.
```

Which generate the statistics.
